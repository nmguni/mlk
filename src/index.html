              Montgomery bus and was arrested. Activists coordinated a bus
              boycott that would continue for 381 days. Martin Luther King, Jr.
              as the protest’s leader and official spokesman. influenced by
              Mahatma Gandhi and the activist Bayard Rustin—had entered the
              national spotlight as an inspirational proponent of organized,
              nonviolent resistance.

              severe test during the Birmingham campaign of 1963, in which
              activists used a boycott, sit-ins and marches to protest
              segregation, unfair hiring practices and other injustices in one
              of America’s most racially divided cities.

              <h4>March on Washington</h4>
              Later that year, Martin Luther King, Jr. worked with a number of
              civil rights and religious groups to organize the March on
              Washington for Jobs and Freedom, a peaceful political rally
              designed to shed light on the injustices African Americans
              continued to face across the country.

              known as the “I Have a Dream” speech, a spirited call for peace
              and equality that many consider a masterpiece of rhetoric.
